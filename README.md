# ATtiny10
Examples for the ATtiny10 boads from CanHobby.ca

This is a collection of Arduino Sketches designed to accompany <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvXAxIBATr45rQ-Euz4ix217g1AwmIlRl" target=_blank>my YouTube videos</a> covering the ATtiny10 dev boards from <a href="https://CanHobby.ca/attiny" target=_blank>CanHobby</a>.  There is a <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/195723-blink-sketches-for-the-attiny10-led-from-canhobby" target=_blank>Hackaday Blog</a> as well.
There are 4 different breadboard compatible modules:
<ul>
  <li>ATTiny10-Solo Bare Bones dev kit with all 6 pins brought out.</li>
  <li>ATTiny10-LED dev kit with an LED on pin B1.</li>
  <li>ATTiny10-Reset dev kit with a Reset Switch.</li>
  <li>ATTiny10-Fun dev kit with 3 LEDs on B0, B1, and B2, plus ICSP header.</li>
</ul>
All of these sketches make use of the <a href="https://github.com/technoblogy/attiny10core" target=_blank>ATtiny10Core from Technoblogy</a> for the Arduino IDE.  The sketches illustrate the use of "registr programming" which is a lower level, just 1 step above assembler, but is emminitely suitable for the constrained flash and, especially, the RAM inside of the ATtiny10.  It uses the Arduino IDE to edit, compile and upload.
