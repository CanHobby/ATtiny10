# ATtiny10
Examples for the ATtiny10 boads from CanHobby.ca

This is a collection of Arduino Sketches designed to accompany by YouTube videos covering the ATtiny dev boards from <a href="https://CanHobby.ca/attiny" target=_blank>CanHobby</a>.
There are 4 different breadboard compatible modules:
<ul>
  <li>ATTiny-Solo Bare Bones dev kit with all 6 pins brought out.</li>
  <li>ATTiny-LED dev kit with an LED on pin B1.</li>
  <li>ATTiny-Reset dev kit with a Reset Switch.</li>
  <li>ATTiny-Fun dev kit with 3 LEDs on B0, B2, and B2.</li>
</ul>
All of these sketches make use of the <a href="https://github.com/technoblogy/attiny10core" target=_blank>ATtiny10Core from Technoblogy</a>.  The sketches illustrate the use of "registr programming" which is a lower level, just 1 step above assembler, but is emminitely suitable for the constrained flash and, especially, the RAM inside of the ATtiny10.
